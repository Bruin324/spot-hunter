user clicks on map,
modal pops up
 would you like to add this as a spot?
Y N
if Y ---
    if logged in ---
        details modal 
            -type
            -occuppied 
            -notes
        Submit
    if not logged in ---
        Sorry you must be logged in
         - register button
         - login button
if N ---
    modal closes and marker goes away


need to separate out my services and reducers and actions

remove marker - to fire if user clicks "no" or if x is clicked in detail modal
may want to consider refactoring the marker render so that marker is a component. probably would be much easier, but would take a lot of time.
